           <p>HTML and CSS are the building blocks of every webpage 
               you see on the internet. Thus, to become a web developer 
               you need to know these two languages. In this page, I cover
               the basics of the two languages. You can use this as a note 
               or a reference to help you on your web development journey.
             </p>

             <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
             <p>All HTML contents are enclosed in tags; text, images,
                 videos etc. are put in tags. The content is put between opening 
                 and closing tags. The content together with the opening
                 and closing tags form an HTML element.
                 Below is a paragraph element which displays text:<br>
                 &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt; <br>
                 As seen above, the text 'This is a paragraph' begins with an opening 
                 tag, which is made of the tag name (p) enclosed in a less than and greater 
                 than sign. It is then ended in a closing tag, which has a forward slash after
                 the less than sign.
                 However, not all content have closing tags. Some tags are self-closing and 
                 hence do not need a closing tag. An example is the image (img) tag which is 
                 used show images. It is shown below: <br>
                 &lt;img src="image.png"&gt;<br>
                 As seen above, there is no need for a closing tag. Another way of representing
                 self-closing tags is &lt;img&gt;<br>
                 Did you notice the src="image.png", this is an attribute and you can learn more 
                 about them in the <a href="#">attribute section</a>.
                 The tables below shows some basic HTML tags and their uses.

                <h2>HTML Tag Attributes</h2>
                <p>HTML attributes are keywords that are put in opening tags to modify
                    the behavior of the element.
                    In our HTML tags section we saw an example of an attribute: <br>
                    &lt;img src="image.png"&gt;<br>
                here src (source) is the  attribute, and it is used to specify location of 
                the image file. This can be a folder within your desktop, or a location on
                the internet. Below is a table showing some HTML tag attributes and their use.

                <table>
